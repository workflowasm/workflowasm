// A CodeSinkService is the target of the WorkflowASM linker when it builds
// and uploads new assemblies.
//
// NOTE: any network endpoints for this service should be appropriately secured
// as it would allow an attacker to replace running code in any workers
// connected to the corresponding `CodeSourceService`. The assembler creates
// a virtual version of this service when working in a local filesystem; the
// most secure path is to assemble code locally and push it via CI/CD to
// the running `CodeSource` in your live environment.
